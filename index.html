                <h1 class="margin">What is Cold Emailing?</h1>
                <p>A cold email is a tailored, one-to-one message sent to a person you don’t already know. Its goal is to engage that person in a business-related conversation rather than advertise a product or service to the masses. That is why your subject line has to stand out and make the prospect want to open your email.
                </p>
                <p>You can think of cold emailing as the email version of cold calling. It is quite different from sending transactional and warm emails and is a subcategory of email marketing.
                </p>


                <h1 class="margin">Tips To Write Catchy Email Subject Lines For Sales</h1>
                <h3>1. Keep it short</h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keep-It-To-A-Minimum-Tips-To-Write-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-For-Sales-SalesBlink-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>Remember that the ideal length of an email subject line differs across mobile, desktop, and tablet platforms. So, you have to keep that in mind when crafting the perfect one-liner for your sales email. The maximum subject line length is usually around 60 characters before it gets cut it off. Keeping the length to 41 characters ensures that your entire subject line appears on all the devices.

                </p>
                <!-- 2nd point start -->
                <h3>2. Use Personalization                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Personalize-It-Tips-To-Write-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-For-Sales-SalesBlink-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>It’s usually a good idea to personalize the subject line with the prospect’s name. According to Stats, 74 per cent of marketers claim that customizing emails results in a 20% boost in income. People prefer to connect with people rather than large brands and corporations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use your own email address or alias that contains your first name instead of a generic address like sales@imsellingtoyou.com to look credible.
                </p>
                <!-- 2nd point end -->
                <!-- 3rd start -->
                <h3>3. Make it Engaging                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Make-It-Engaging-Tips-To-Write-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-For-Sales-SalesBlink-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>We’ve all been told to avoid judging a book by its cover, but that doesn’t apply to sales email subject lines. Before readers reach your email, they must first get through the subject line and it has to be engaging,
                </p>
                <p>Making your email subject lines catchy involves a lot of things. You can start the conversation by mentioning the following:

                </p>
                <p>– A recent development in their industry
                </p>
                <p>– A new piece of information about their industry

                </p>
                <p>– A question about their project they just started or finished

                </p>
                <p>– A request for their help

                </p>
                <p>These viewpoints have one thing in common: they’re all about the prospect. You’ll have many opportunities to market your product in the email body and on subsequent calls. The basic purpose of your subject line is to entice the reader to click through, read more, and decide whether or not they are interested enough to reply or take action.
                </p>
                <!-- 3rd end  -->
                <h3>4. Provide Value
                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Provide-Value-Tips-To-Write-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-For-Sales-SalesBlink-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>Offering something of value to prospects in your email is the best way to build a connection. It could be any downloadable resource such as an e-book or a whitepaper that is relevant to them. When you mention it in the subject line, the prospect will be interested in opening your email, and that’s what you aim at, right?
                </p>
          
                <h3>5. Create a Sense of Urgency
                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Create-Sense-Of-Urgency-Tips-To-Write-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-For-Sales-SalesBlink.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>Because time sensitivity is a popular filter that many of us use to prioritize our inboxes, it’s obvious that our prospects use it as well. Even if your prospect isn’t interested in making a purchase right now, knowing that they might miss out on the chance will make them close the deal sooner. That’s how a limited-time-only promotion works. Using urgency to get your emails opened and read is a tried-and-tested strategy, but don’t rely on it all of the time. You could annoy your prospect by using the tactic too frequently.
                </p>

                 
                <h3>6. Avoid Clickbait
                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Avoid-Clickbaits-Tips-To-Write-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-For-Sales-SalesBlink.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>Along the same lines as annoying your prospect, don’t write subject lines that aren’t at par with the content of the email, product, or service. Such subject lines don’t get opened.
                </p>
                <p>If you make tall claims in the subject line and they are not a part of the email content, it might leave a sour taste in your prospect’s mouth. Even worse, the prospect may mark you as spam. Check your subject line against our final list of spam trigger words to avoid an extra layer of confidence.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Include Keywords
                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Include-Keyword-Tips-To-Write-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-For-Sales-SalesBlink.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>Keywords are another element prospects use to organize and filter their inboxes. Including certain keywords in your email subject line can help you get into the prospect’s inbox, and you can review it later. There’s no magic trick to find out what filters and rules your prospects use. You just have to be creative and A/B test. It will help figure out the keywords that have a greater impact on your open rates than others.
                </p>
                
                <h3>8. Build Genuine Connection
                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Build-Genuine-Connection-Tips-To-Write-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-For-Sales-SalesBlink.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>Aim to make the recipient feel that you sincerely want to help them by offering your product or service.  Complimenting them or mentioning an event you both attended could be an example of this. The best sales emails establish a genuine connection rather than aiming to seal the transaction as quickly as possible. Unless you’re conducting very high-volume, low-value transactional transactions, which is often the case with B2C e-commerce, don’t use limited-time deals.
                </p>
                <p>Example 1: [Name], it was great to meet you at [event you both attended]!</p>
                <p>Example 2: Do you have an interest in [product/service] or not? 
                <p>Doesn’t example 1 look better than example 2?
                    </p>
                </p>

                
                <h3>9. Keep it Conversational

                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keep-In-Casual-Tips-To-Write-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-For-Sales-SalesBlink-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>If your email is way too formal and cold, and business-like, the prospect may not show any interest. So, avoid sounding like a conventional email marketing message and avoid being too formal. Something a little more relaxed may appeal to you and make your email feel more friendly. Some sales teams have had tremendous success utilizing emojis in subject lines, but be sure that this holds good for your target audience. However, you shouldn’t be too casual with the prospect. The basic “quick question” subject line is the simplest one, and it still works well on every occasion.
                </p>
                <p>‘Can we chat about [their company/your products/services/etc.]?’ is definitely better than ‘What’s up, [name]? Hit me up if you’re interested in [product/service]’
                </p>

                

                
                <h3>10. Ask Open Ended Questions
                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ask-Questions-Tips-To-Write-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-For-Sales-SalesBlink-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>Questions may pique someone’s curiosity and persuade them to open an email. Are you wondering why that happens? The brain gets stimulated when a question is put forth, and that is why it is a good tactic to ask a question. You can push a prospect down the sales funnel. Sales questions are essential whether you’re trying to make them feel useful by asking for facts or making them analyze their requirements and wants.
                </p>

                
                <h3>11. Experiment a Little 
                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Experiment-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-SalesBlink-1024x804.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>To find out a subject line that works, you have to experiment a little, which can take time. If you happen to find a subject line that works, it doesn’t mean that you can sit back and relax. You still have to A/B test different subject lines. Eventually, you would understand what kind of subject lines are working so that you can stick to them most often. 
                </p>

                
                <h3>12. Make Use of Persuasive Words
                </h3>
                <img src="https://salesblink.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Use-of-Persuasive-Words-Catchy-Email-Subject-Lines-SalesBlink-1-1024x804.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
                <p>Words are immensely powerful as they can substantially impact the recipient. Certain words make the recipient want to click open an email. Humans are emotional and curious beings and are not able to control themselves. When you use certain persuasive words, prospects can’t stop themselves from opening your email. 
                </p>
                <p>Words like ‘astonishing’, ‘banned’, ‘insane’, ‘unique’ and ‘secret’ arouse curiosity while ones like ‘best’, ‘certified’, ‘endorsed’, ‘expert’ help build trust.
